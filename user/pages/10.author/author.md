# About Us

We're a team of game developers and designers.  Some of our released titles are CodeSpells, Vox-L, and LearnToMod.  We have other titles in development (The Planes, and Torb).  We used to release under the brand [ThoughtSTEM, which does lots of stuff](http://thoughtstem.com).   However, we decided to launch a game studio to differentiate our games from all that other stuff.

We also offer consulting and prototyping services.  Collectively, we have decades of experience developing video games.  Let us know if you could use some help.  Or just contact us if you're curious.  We're friendly people.
